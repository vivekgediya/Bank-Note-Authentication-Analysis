# Bank Note Authentication_Analysis

Whenever we go to the bank to deposit some cash money, the cashier places banknotes in a machine which tells whether a banknote is real or not. This is a classification problem where we are given some input data and we have to classify the input into one of the several predefined categories. Rule-based as well as statistical techniques are commonly used for solving classification problems. Machine learning algorithms fall in the category of statistical techniques.

In this article, we explain the process of building a banknote authentication system using machine learning algorithms. After reading this article, you will be able to understand how classification systems are built using machine learning algorithms.

We are going to perform various machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, KNN Classifier and simple Nueral Network) using Sci-Kitlearn.
